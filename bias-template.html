            <p> <b>1. Positionality</b> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What are the <b>backgrounds and identities</b> of the researchers? (e.g., race, ethnicity, class, gender, education, upbringing, political beliefs, hierarchical position)</li>
                <li>How might these identities have influenced how the researchers <b>approach research</b>? (e.g., worldview, epistemology, objectives)</li>
                <li><b>How do these identities relate</b> to the participants and/or context of the research? (e.g., in what ways are the researchers insiders or outsiders? Are there power imbalances?)</li>
            </ul>  

            <p> <b>2. Framing</b> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What <b>narratives</b> underlie the formulation of the problem or research questions? What kinds of <b>solutions</b> do these narratives invite? What are the principal entities and <b>actors</b> in these narratives? Were they included in helping frame the problem?</li>
                <li>What might be <b>missing</b> from this framing? Which groups might be <b>(dis)advantaged</b> by this framing? <b>Who has decided</b> about this framing?</li>
            </ul>                


            <p> <b>3. Action items</b> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is one <b>concrete action</b> the researchers could take to mitigate any potential problems?</li>
            </ul>
