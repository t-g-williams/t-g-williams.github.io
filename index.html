          I explore risk and resilience in agricultural systems using quantitative methods.
          <br>
          My underlying motivation is to enhance understanding of how we can encourage socio-environmental systems
          to develop and transform in a way that promotes both the betterment of society and the prosperity of the environment.
          <br>
          To achieve this, I seek to better understand observed historical relationships (using empirical analysis and data mining)
          and how systems may behave in the future or under intervention (using agent-based modeling).
