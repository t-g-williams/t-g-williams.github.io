          I’m a PhD pre-candidate in the Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering at the University of Michigan.
          I’m a part of the Guikema research group, and my research can be broadly split into two categories:
          <ul>
            <li>Modeling human decision-making with regard to food-energy-water issues; and</li>
            <li>Developing quantitative methods for categorizing urban form.</li>
          </ul>
          I’ve recently moved to the USA from New Zealand, where I studied Natural Resources Engineering at the University of Canterbury.
          My long-term goals are to advance the understanding of how coupled human-natural systems function, and how we can transition these systems in a way that promotes both the betterment of society and the prosperity of the environment.
