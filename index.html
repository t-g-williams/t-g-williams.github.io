          I model resilience in agricultural systems.
          <br>
          <br>
          My goal as a researcher is to improve understanding of how agricultural systems can
          transition to become more sustainable (both socially and environmentally) in the face of global change.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Environmental Geography Group at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.
          My research here focuses on modelling transformation in European agriculture.
          <br>
          <br>
          In August 2021, I graduated with a PhD in Industrial & Operations Engineering from the University of Michigan.
          In my dissertation I used agent-based modelling to examine strategies for building resilience in smallholder agricultural systems.
          My postdoctoral research builds on this prior experience by transitioning to a European context and a larger scale of modelling.
