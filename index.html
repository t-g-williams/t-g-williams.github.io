          I model resilience and transformation in agri-food systems.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am an interdisciplinarian -- an engineer turned geographer -- with expertise in using various quantitative and 
          qualitative methods to examine sustainability in agriculture.
          I am interested in exploring how agricultural and food systems can transition to become
          more sustainable and equitable in the face of global change.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am currently working at <a href="https://www.climatefarmers.org/">Climate Farmers</a>
          as an Environmental Modeller & Researcher. 
          I am part of the Science team, where we design and improve methodologies for measuring regeneration
          in European farms.
          <br>
          <br>
          From August 2021 to February 2024 I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Environmental Geography Group at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.
          My research focused on understanding the networks of actors that impact European agriculture, 
          and the power relations embedded in their interactions.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2021, I graduated with a PhD in Industrial & Operations Engineering from the University of Michigan.
          In my dissertation I used agent-based modelling to examine strategies for building resilience in smallholder agricultural systems.
          My postdoctoral research builds on this prior experience by transitioning to a European context and a larger scale of analysis.
