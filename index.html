          I model resilience and transformation in agri-food systems.
          <br>
          <br>
          I am an interdisciplinary researcher with experience using various quantitative and 
          qualitative methods to examine hmuan-environment interactions in agricultural and food systems.
          I am interested in exploring how these systems can transition to become
          more sustainable and equitable in the face of global change.
          <br>
          <br>
          Since March 2025 I have been employed as a Senior Scientist at Universit√§t Hohenheim. 
          My work focuses on modelling the joint impacts of transitions to organic agriculture
          on ecological and economic outcomes.
          <br>
          <br>           
          From March 2024 to January 2025 I worked as an Environmental Modeller & Researcher
          at <a href="https://www.climatefarmers.org/">Climate Farmers</a>. 
          As part of the Science team, I developed methodologies for quantifying carbon sequestration
          in regenerative farms.
          <br>
          <br>
          From August 2021 to February 2024 I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the Environmental Geography Group at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam.
          My research focused on understanding the networks of actors that impact European agriculture, 
          and the power relations embedded in their interactions.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2021, I graduated with a PhD in Industrial & Operations Engineering from the University of Michigan.
          In my dissertation I used agent-based modelling to examine strategies for building resilience in smallholder agricultural systems.
          My postdoctoral research builds on this prior experience by transitioning to a European context and a larger scale of analysis.
