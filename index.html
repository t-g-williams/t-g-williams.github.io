          I model risk and resilience in smallholder agricultural systems.
          <br>
          <br>
          My underlying motivation is to encourage agricultural systems
          to develop and transform in a way that promotes both the betterment of society and the prosperity of the environment.
          <br>
          <br>
          To achieve this, I use both agent-based modeling to examine how systems may behave in the future or under intervention
          and empirical analysis and data mining to better understand observed historical relationships.
          I am broadly interested in the intersection of these two forms of analysis.
