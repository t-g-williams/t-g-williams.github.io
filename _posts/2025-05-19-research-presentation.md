A few months ago, I presented my postdoctoral research on power dynamics in the Complex Systems Seminar "Science Jam" at Utrecht University.

It's always instructive (and a little uncomfortable) to watch and hear yourself on camera. 
I'm appreciating my relaxed presentation style here, but definitely would like to cut down on the "ums" and "ahs" that seem to liberally pad my sentences!
It's also reassuring to hear that I haven't completely lost my New Zealand accent.
